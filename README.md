This is a game I am developing for mobile and desktop. 
Geometry Ninja is about a ninja trying to cut falling shapes before they hit the bottom of the screen.
As the player progresses in levels the shapes start falling in more erratic ways to make them harder to cut. 
After the player reaches level 6 chi begins to spawn, and when they are cut they give the player 1 extra life.
At first the chi spawns in small quantities and then starts spawning more as the player reaches higher levels.
There are also powerups in the game and when cut they give different effects to the player.
Currently the only powerups in the game eare time stop and flame mode.
Time stop is represented as a small blue circle.
Flame mode is represented as a small orange circle. 
Time stop freezes the falling shapes for 3 seconds allowing the player to cut the frozen shapes.
Flame mode allows the player to leave a trail of fire that burns the falling shapes and lasts for 3 seconds. 
The player starts off with 3 lives.
When the shapes reach the bottom it takes 1 life from the user.
When the shapes are cut they give a score value of the number of sides it has.
For example a square gives 4 points and a triangle gives 3 points.
I am still developing the game and plan of adding a store and gold system.
The store will be optional for the player when the level ends.
The gold system will be based on the sides of the shape. 
For example when a square is cut it will give the player 4 gold and when a triangle is cut it will give the player 3 gold. 
I am also working on a story for the ge that will be told in the form of 10 chapters. After the player defeats a boss they will unlock a new chapter and be shown text that explains the lore of the world and why the ninja is fighting against the falling shapes. 
I am planning on there being 10 chapters and a chapteris revealed every 10th level. So there will be 100 levels in total.
